# Post-processing Stack

Two versions of the post-processing stack are available:

- [Version 1.x](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/tree/v1): Stable, production-ready post-processing stack.
- [Version 2.x](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/tree/v2): Under active development, holds the upcoming version of the post-processing stack. Although it is fairly stable at this point it is still considered to be in a beta state.
