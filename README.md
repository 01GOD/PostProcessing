# Post-processing Stack

Two versions of the post-processing stack are available:

- [Version 1.x](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/tree/v1): Stable, production-ready post-processing stack **(recommended)**.
- [Version 2.x](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/tree/v2): Under active development, considered highly unstable and shouldn't be used in production at this time. Use at your own risk.
